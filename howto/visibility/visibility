For example, perhaps you want an animation to start on scroll, rather than via play button. Or perhaps you want to avoid computing an expensive cell when it is offscreen.\n\nObservable’s [visibility promise](https://github.com/observablehq/notebook-stdlib/blob/master/README.md#visibility) provides a convenient mechanism for responding to changes in cell visibility: this promise resolves when a cell becomes visible. If the cell is already visible, the promise is immediately resolved. And if the cell is [invalidated](https://github.com/observablehq/notebook-stdlib/blob/master/README.md#invalidation) before it becomes visible, the promise is rejected to avoid wasted effort.\n\n(Under the hood, the visibility promise uses [intersection observers](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API).)\n\nFor example, the following greeting is deferred until the cell is visible:`","pinCode":false}}},{"type":"codeTool","data":{"codeData":{"value":"{\n  await visibility();\n  return md`Hello, world!`;\n}","pinCode":false}}},{"type":"codeTool","data":{"codeData":{"value":"md`You can likewise await visibility repeatedly in a loop, causing an animation to run only when the cell is visible and to pause when the cell is offscreen:`","pinCode":false}}},{"type":"codeTool","data":{"codeData":{"value":"i = {\n  for (let i = 0; true; ++i) {\n    yield visibility(i);\n  }\n}","pinCode":false}}},{"type":"codeTool","data":{"codeData":{"value":"md`Try scrolling down.
