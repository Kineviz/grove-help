These take a bunch of forms in traditional JavaScript:\n\n\\`\\`\\`js\n// Good ol' setTimeout lets you run a function after a given\n// number of milliseconds.\nsetTimeout(() => console.log('hi!'), 1000);\n\n\n// setInterval is like that, but runs a function 'every' given\n// number of milliseconds.\nsetInterval(() => console.log('hi!'), 1000);\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nNow timers will still ‘work’ in Observable, but a lot of the time they’ll cut against the grain. That's because cells are often _re-evaluated_, so it's important that everything a cell does can be cleaned up. Timers tend to just glom on to a page. If you set an interval, evaluate that JavaScript, and then evaluate it 10 more times, you just get 10 timers.\n\nFor example, let's say you wanted a cell that was an ever-increasing number, which ticks upward every 1 second. Probably the most ‘idiomatic’ way to do this is with Promises.delay. Consult the excellent [standard library notebook](https://beta.observablehq.com/@mbostock/standard-library) for all the details here.`","pinCode":false,"dname":"d61de40d-94a6-4727-8d3e-a9a099fafe1f","codeMode":"javascript2","vimEnabled":false,"insertMode":false}}},{"type":"codeTool","data":{"codeData":{"value":"{\n  let i = 0;\n  yield i;\n  while (true) {\n    yield Promises.delay(1000, ++i);\n  }\n}","pinCode":false,"dname":"e073c45c-e32c-4651-9425-972d3c2a56c5","codeMode":"javascript2"}}},{"type":"codeTool","data":{"codeData":{"value":"md`The example above is pretty good, if I might say so myself: it automatically pauses when you leave the tab, it isn't much code, it ‘cleans up’ and restarts easily when you re-evaluate the cell.\n\nHow would you do that with setInterval?

Mutation being defined here as ‘changing a variable in-place’: not creating a new variable that’s some modification of an old one, but instead changing the original variable's value. Some common sources of mutation in JavaScript are:\n\n- Array methods like .sort() and .splice() that modify arrays in-place\n- Similar methods on custom objects that modify them\n- Stateful regular expression methods\n\nFor example, here’s a notebook that has a cell that defines an array, another that mutates that array in-place by splicing out an element from it.`)","pinCode":false,"dname":"bf4e2d83-502f-4e62-989d-b04b15a07bab","codeMode":"javascript2"}}},{"type":"codeTool","data":{"codeData":{"value":"a = ([1, 2, 3, 4])","pinCode":false,"dname":"ef41ce8e-f3fd-4aba-8ead-d2ae1ffab495","codeMode":"javascript2"}}},{"type":"codeTool","data":{"codeData":{"value":"a.splice(0, 1)","pinCode":false,"dname":"f6d17d34-3e88-4ae9-8258-5cec922dfe62","codeMode":"javascript2"}}},{"type":"codeTool","data":{"codeData":{"value":"a.length","pinCode":false,"dname":"cc67717e-10a9-435f-a7a3-b0ab18f77605","codeMode":"javascript2"}}},{"type":"codeTool","data":{"codeData":{"value":"md`Note that when you run the second cell - the one that calls \\`.splice\\` - the third one, the one that displays \\`a.length\\`, doesn't automatically update.

One of my favorite things about Observable notebooks is that _cell evaluation order doesn't matter_. They don't run top-to-bottom, they simply run whenever values are needed or updated. Mutation really mucks that up.\n\nLuckily, this is a pitfall that can be avoided. When you run into a method that works by default with mutation, you can make your code nice and ‘immutable’ instead by:\n\n- Using an alternative that doesn't mutate the data - for instance, using [Array#concat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat), which returns a new Array, instead of [Array#push](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push), which modifies an array in-place\n- Making a copy of the data and mutating that: for instance, by using [Array#slice()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice)\n\nHere's an example of the latter, as an alternative to the code-smelly example you just tried.

That's an example of something that looks like it'd work in JavaScript in the wild, but isn't a good idea here.

And if two cells don't have a dependency relationship - one cell doesn't rely on the other's name - there's no guarantee that they'll run in any specific order. This is a _good thing_. In math class, when your teacher says \"What’s the sum of a and b, if a is 5 and b is 4?\", your brain doesn’t crash because you don’t know the value of a and b _before_ hearing the first part of the question.
