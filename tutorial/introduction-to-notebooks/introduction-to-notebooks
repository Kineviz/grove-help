It’s a computer program, but one that’s designed to be easier to read and write by humans.\n\nA notebook can be used as a scratchpad for exploring data, or to explain quantitative phenomena. Because the code runs live in your browser, notebooks are also a powerful medium for studying dynamic systems and algorithms. (See Stephen Wolfram’s [What Is a Computational Essay?](http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2017/11/what-is-a-computational-essay/) for more.)\n\nNotebooks are comprised of cells. A *cell* can be pretty much anything. For example, a cell might contain a few paragraphs of text, like this one. Or a cell might contain images, videos, charts, or other graphical and interactive elements. A cell can also contain data structures, like numbers, strings, arrays and objects. Functions, too.`","pinCode":false,"dname":"aefb9aa1-2a94-47d2-9fdb-24e32f7e79cd","codeMode":"javascript2"}}},{"type":"codeTool","data":{"codeData":{"value":"image = (flood)","pinCode":false,"dname":"3c8dd0c5-e57d-4ac4-a9dc-8599a71de691","codeMode":"javascript2"}}},{"type":"codeTool","data":{"codeData":{"value":"height = (160)","pinCode":false,"dname":"88427119-8493-4979-9b9c-a10bc0e2a59f","codeMode":"javascript2"}}},{"type":"codeTool","data":{"codeData":{"value":"md`Each cell, even a simple text cell like this one, is defined by a snippet of code.
