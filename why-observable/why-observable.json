Yet to gain insight from data, we need analysis—and that means we need *code*. Point-and-click interfaces are incapable of expressing the novel questions posed by data science. Code is essential as a <a href=\"http://michaelnielsen.org/reinventing_explanation/\" title=\"Michael Nielsen - Reinventing Explanation\">medium for thought</a>.\n\n<b>Observable</b> is a web-first <a href=\"/@observablehq/introduction-to-notebooks\">interactive notebook</a> for data analysis, visualization, and exploration. By bringing data science from the command line to the web, we can make it more accessible, more collaborative, and more effective. We can equip the world’s largest <a href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017\" title=\"Stack Overflow - Developer Survey 2017\">developer community</a> with the world’s most powerful medium for communication.\n\nObservable is <a href=\"https://medium.com/@mbostock/a-better-way-to-code-2b1d2876a3a0\" title=\"Mike Bostock - A Better Way to Code\">a better way</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT4JvF7sglg\" title=\"Mike Bostock - csv,conf,v3 Keynote\">to code</a>.`","pinCode":false,"dname":"0321f31f-707b-4ba1-a57b-82b8c24b0aff","codeMode":"javascript2"}}},{"type":"codeTool","data":{"codeData":{"value":"md`## What makes Observable different?\n\nObservable notebooks let you focus more on what matters—discovering and communicating quantitative insights—and less on the arcana of <a href=\"http://worrydream.com/KillMath/\" title=\"Bret Victor - Kill Math\">manipulating abstract symbols</a>.\n\nAn Observable notebook consists of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming\" title=\"Wikipedia - Reactive programming\">reactive</a> cells, each defining a piece of state. Rather than track dependencies between mutable values in your head, the runtime automatically extracts dependencies via <a href=\"https://github.com/ternjs/acorn\" title=\"Acorn, an ECMAScript parser\">static analysis</a> and efficiently re-evaluates cells whenever things change, like a spreadsheet. Complex user interfaces can be expressed as simple, <a href=\"https://rauchg.com/2015/pure-ui\" title=\"Guillermo Rauch - Pure UI\">pure functions</a> of state.\n\nReactivity at the language layer avoids the boilerplate typical of frameworks and enables <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_programming\" title=\"Wikipedia - Interactive programming\">interactive programming</a> without the cost of live reload. Cells can refer interchangeably to constants, asynchronous data, user interface-driven state, and even dynamic variables.\n\nObservable notebooks have unfettered access to powerful graphics capabilities, including SVG, Canvas and WebGL. Build fluid exploratory interfaces without the latency of server round-trips. Test hypotheses by manipulating live simulations. <a href=\"https://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/\" title=\"Mike Bostock - Visualizing Algorithms\">Visualize algorithms</a> as they run.

Exploratory analysis may bring insight to the mind of the analyst, but insight’s true value comes when it is communicated to further understanding and action. A pretty chart is not the end goal; each visualization must point to its underlying data and code to allow an <a href=\"http://worrydream.com/ExplorableExplanations/\" title=\"Bret Victor - Explorable Explanations\">active reader</a> to question assumptions, consider alternatives, and derive new insights.\n\nObservable will allow teams to collaborate and communicate in realtime over the web.
