language that unifies classes and aspects. We call our new module construct the  classpect . We make three basic claims. First, we can realize a unified design without significantly compromising the expressiveness of current aspect languages. Second, such a design improves the conceptual integrity of the programming model. Third, it significantly improves the compositionality of aspect modules, expanding the program design space from the two-layered model of AspectJ-like languages to include hierarchical structures. To support these claims, we present the design and implementation of Eos-U, an AspectJ-like language based on C# that supports classpects as the basic unit of modularity. We show that Eos-U supports layered designs in which classpects separate integration concerns flexibly at multiple levels of composition. The underpinnings of our design include support for aspect instantiation under program control, instance-level advising, advising as a  general  alternative to object-oriented method invocation and overriding, and the provision of a separate join-point-method binding construct.\",title:\"Classpects: unifying aspect- and object-oriented language design\",pagerank:0.5187937500000002,n_citation:\"141\"})"},{"n":"(3413072:Article {louvain:\"12558\",year:\"2006\",wcc:\"0\",index:\"01f1d231-80ae-4cce-b56c-9d821e0924d0\",abstract:\"null\",title:\"Using Classpects for Integrating Non-Functional and Functional Requirements.\",pagerank:0.15000000000000002,n_citation:\"1\"})","e":"(3413072)-[:CITED]->(3416519)","m":"(3416519:Article {louvain:\"12558\",year:\"1995\",wcc:\"0\",index:\"9f172585-8d42-4fce-b6ae-aede321f3fd4\",abstract:\"Quality characteristics are vital for the success of software systems. To remedy the problems inherent in ad hoc development, a framework has been developed to deal with non-functional requirements (quality requirements or NFRs). Taking the premise that the quality of a product depends on the quality of the process that leads from high-Ievel NFRs to the product, the framework's objectives are to represent NFR-specific requirements, consider design tradeoffs, relate design decisions to IYFRs, justify the decisions, and assist defect detection. The purpose of this paper is to give an initial evaluation of the extent to which the framework's objectives are met. Three small portions of information systems were studied by the authors using the framework. The framework and empirical studies are evaluated herein, both from the viewpoint of domain experts who have reviewed the framework and studies, and ourselves as framework developers and users. The systems studied have a variety of characteristics, reflecting a variety of real application domains, and the studies deal with three important classes of NFRs for systems, namely, accuracy, security, and performance. The studies provide preliminary support for the usefulness of certain aspects of the framework, while raising some open issues.\",title:\"Dealing with non-functional requirements: three experimental studies of a process-oriented approach\",pagerank:0.5015347656250001,n_citation:\"280\"})"},{"n":"(3413073:Article {louvain:\"319\",year:\"2009\",wcc:\"0\",index:\"0e6ce7a9-6456-437b-9f3f-4bda192a6fae\",abstract:\"null\",title:\"Solution Proposals for Japan-Oriented Offshore Software Development in China\",pagerank:0.15000000000000002,n_citation:\"2\"})","e":"(3413073)-[:CITED]->(3416522)","m":"(3416522:Article {louvain:\"4913\",year:\"2006\",wcc:\"0\",index:\"563bdfaf-91c2-4440-b146-54954bf7ee48\",abstract:\"In order to popularize the Test Driven Development (TDD) practice in Chinese offshore companies, an experimental research was firstly conducted to compare TDD with the traditional waterfall development in a small-scale project.

common conceptual basis for analyzing transaction service configurations","abstract":"Transaction management services play an important role in modern component technologies, such as Enterprise

They are provided as middleware service by the container, which requires configuration information to apply them properly to the application. In our work, we follow a model-driven transaction service configuration approach to allow transaction design early in the software engineering process. An important element of our approach is a common conceptual basis for describing, analyzing, and comparing transaction service configurations. It also supports the notion of contract with regard to transactional logic, which is a prerequisite for the reliable composition of components to component-based applications. In this paper, we present our approach to model-driven service configuration and introduce a common set of concepts for describing transaction service configurations.","published_for":"international conference on software engineering"},{"title":"Investigating and improving a COTS-based software development process","abstract":"The work described in this paper is an investigation of COTS-based software development within a particular NASA environment, with an emphasis on the processes used.

This process is evaluated to identify essential differences in comparison to traditional software development. The main differences, and the activities for which projects require more guidance, are requirements definition and COTS selection, high level design, integration and testing.  Starting from these empirical observations, a new process and guidelines for COTS-based development are developed and briefly presented.

With this architecture, a developer chooses from a collection of pre-existing components or, using high-level component generators, constructs new components and combines them to produce a data flow analyzer. In addition to support for traditional data flow analysis problems, this architecture supports the development of analyzers for a class of combined data flow problems that offer increased precision. This architecture allows developers to investigate quickly and easily a wide variety of analyzer design alternatives and to understand the practical design tradeoffs better. We describe our experience using this architecture to construct a variety of different data flow analyzers.","published_for":"international conference on software engineering"},{"title":"Usability-supporting architectural patterns","abstract":"Software architects have techniques to deal with many quality attributes such as performance, reliability, and maintainability. Usability, however, has traditionally been concerned primarily with presentation and not been a concern of software architects beyond separating the user interface from the remainder of the application. In this paper, we present usability-supporting architectural patterns. Each pattern describes a usability concern that is not supported by separation alone. For each concern, a usability-supporting architectural pattern provides the forces from the characteristics of the task and environment, the human, and the state of the software to motivate an implementation independent solution cast in terms of the responsibilities that must be fulfilled to satisfy the forces. Furthermore, each pattern includes a sample solution implemented in the context of an overriding separation based pattern such as J2EE Model View Controller.","published_for":"international conference on software engineering"},{"title":"Analysis of execution log files","abstract":"Log analysis can be used to find problems, define operational profiles, and even pro-actively prevent issues.

Too often it is introduced as a last- minute requirement over an otherwise completed product rather than properly integrated during the early stages of software design and development. One significant aspect of security involves access control. This paper proposes a multi-layer model detailing the integration of trust management access control with an application's model behavior. Our previous work focused on modeling the dynamic changes of a trust management policy for the purpose of verifying security properties using model checking. We are working toward integrating both the trust management policy and the mechanisms that enforce that policy for the purpose of verifying security properties. We focus on the Role-based Trust Management (RT) language and suggest concerns specific to it.","published_for":"international conference on software engineering"},{"title":"Finding failures by cluster analysis of execution profiles","abstract":"We experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of using cluster analysis of execution profiles to find failures among the executions induced by a set of potential test cases.

The results suggest that filtering procedures based on clustering are more effective than simple random sampling for identifying failures in populations of operational executions, with adaptive sampling from clusters being the most effective sampling strategy. The results also suggest that clustering metrics that give extra weight to industrial profile features are most effective. Scatter plots of execution populations, produced by multidimensional scaling, are used to provide intuition for these results.","published_for":"international conference on software engineering"},{"title":"Parallel Data Reuse Theory for OpenMP Applications","abstract":"The development of multi-core processor technology makes parallel programming become more and more popular.

For example, a recent evaluation of five state-of-the-art C/C++ static analysis tools applied to a corpus of code containing common weaknesses revealed that 41% of the potential vulnerabilities were detected by no tool. The problem of deploying resilient software is further complicated because modern software is often assembled from components from many sources. Consequently, it is difficult to know who built a particular component and what processes were used in its construction. Our research goal is to develop and demonstrate technology that provides comprehensive, automated techniques that allow end users to safely execute new software of uncertain provenance.

However, without specifications, developers cannot inspect the execution of each automatically generated test input practically. To address the problem, we have developed an automatic test abstraction tool, called Abstra, to extract high level object-state-transition information from unit-test executions, without requiring a priori specifications. Given a class and a set of its generated test inputs, our tool extracts object state machines (OSM): a state in an OSM represents an object state of the class and a transition in an OSM represents method calls of the class. When an object state in an OSM is concrete (being represented by the values of all fields reachable from the object), the size of the OSM could be too large to be useful for inspection. To address this issue, we have developed techniques in the tool to abstract object states based on returns of observer methods, branch coverage of methods, and individual object fields, respectively. The tool provides useful object-state-transition information for programmers to inspect unit-test executions effectively. In particular, the tool helps facilitate correctness inspection, program understanding, fault isolation, and test characterization.","published_for":"international conference on software engineering"},{"title":"Industrial-strength software product-line engineering","abstract":"Software product-line engineering is one of the few approaches to software engineering that shows promise of improving software productivity by factors of 5 to 10.

In practice, architects often analyse the expected performance and reliability of design alternatives based on prototypes or former experience. Model-driven prediction methods claim to uncover the tradeoffs between different alternatives quantitatively while being more cost-effective and less error-prone. However, they often suffer from weak tool support and focus on single quality attributes. Furthermore, there is limited evidence on their effectiveness based on documented industrial case studies. Thus, we have applied a novel, model-driven prediction method called Q-ImPrESS on a large-scale process control system consisting of several million lines of code from the automation domain to evaluate its evolution scenarios.

Benefits of Q-ImPrESS are the good architectural decision support and comprehensive tool framework, while one drawback is the time-consuming data collection.","published_for":"international conference on software engineering"},{"title":"Finding and analyzing compiler warning defects","abstract":"Good compiler diagnostic warnings facilitate software development as they indicate likely programming mistakes or code smells.

At the high level, our technique starts with generating random programs to trigger compilers to emit a variety of compiler warnings, aligns the warnings from different compilers, and identifies inconsistencies as potential bugs. We develop effective techniques to overcome  three specific challenges : (1) How to generate random programs, (2) how to align textual warnings, and (3) how to reduce test programs for bug reporting?   Our technique is very effective --- we have found and reported 60 bugs for GCC (38 confirmed, assigned or fixed) and 39 for Clang (14 confirmed or fixed). This case study not only demonstrates our technique's effectiveness, but also highlights the need to continue improving compilers' warning support, an essential, but rather neglected aspect of compilers.","published_for":"international conference on software engineering"},{"title":"Automatic model generation from documentation for Java API functions","abstract":"Modern software systems are becoming increasingly complex, relying on a lot of third-party library support. Library behaviors are hence an integral part of software behaviors. Analyzing them is as important as analyzing the software itself. However, analyzing libraries is highly challenging due to the lack of source code, implementation in different languages, and complex optimizations. We observe that many Java library functions provide excellent documentation, which concisely describes the functionalities of the functions. We develop a novel technique that can construct models for Java API functions by analyzing the documentation. These models are simpler implementations in Java compared to the original ones and hence easier to analyze. More importantly, they provide the same functionalities as the original functions. Our technique successfully models 326 functions from 14 widely used Java classes. We also use these models in static taint analysis on Android apps and dynamic slicing for Java programs, demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of our models.","published_for":"international conference on software engineering"},{"title":"Managing by the numbers: a tutorial on quantitative measurement and control of software projects","abstract":"null","published_for":"international conference on software engineering"},{"title":"Personalised continuous software engineering","abstract":"This work describes how human factors can influence continuous software engineering.

In the mean time, IOs can be used intentionally by programmers for benign purposes such as hashing and random number generation. Hence, differentiating exploitable and harmful IOs from intentional and benign ones is an important challenge. It allows reducing the number of false positives produced by IO vulnerability detection techniques, helping developers or security analysts to focus on fixing critical IOs without inspecting the numerous false alarms. The difficulty of recognizing benign IOs mainly lies in inferring the intent of programmers from source code.   In this paper, we present a novel technique to recognize benign IOs via  equivalence checking across multiple precisions . We determine if an IO is benign by comparing the effects of an overflowed integer arithmetic operation in the actual world (with limited precision) and the same operation in the ideal world (with sufficient precision to evade the IO). Specifically, we first extract the data flow path from the overflowed integer arithmetic operation to a security-related program point (i.e., sink) and then create a new version of the path using more precise types with sufficient bits to represent integers so that the IO can be avoided. Using theorem proving we check whether these two versions are equivalent, that is, if they yield the same values at the sink under all possible inputs. If so, the IO is benign. We implement a prototype, named  IntEQ , based on the GCC compiler and the Z3 solver, and evaluate it using 26 harmful IO vulnerabilities from 20 real-world programs, and 444 benign IOs from SPECINT 2000, SPECINT 2006, and 7 real-world applications. The experimental results show that IntEQ does not misclassify any harmful IO bugs (no false negatives) and recognizes 355 out of 444 (about 79.95%) benign IOs, whereas the state of the art can only recognize 19 benign IOs.","published_for":"international conference on software engineering"},{"title":"SE Pioneers Symposium","abstract":"The Pioneers' Symposium provides a forum in which Software Engineering's next generation of researchers, faculty, and practitioners have the opportunity to interact with and learn from some of the field's pioneering thinkers.

Few, if any, empirical studies exist, where pair programming has been systematically under scrutiny in real software development projects. Thus, its proposed benefits remain currently without solid empirical evidence. This paper reports results from four software development projects where the impact of pair programming on software product quality was studied. Our empirical findings appear to offer contrasting results regarding some of the claimed benefits of pair programming. They indicate that pair programming may not necessarily provide as extensive quality benefits as suggested in literature, and on the other hand, does not result in consistently superior productivity when compared to solo programming.","published_for":"international conference on software engineering"},{"title":"Automatized derivation of comprehensive specifications for black-box services","abstract":"Today, cloud vendors host third party black-box services, whose developers usually provide only textual descriptions or purely syntactical interface specifications. Cloud vendors that give substantial support to other third party developers to integrate hosted services into new software solutions would have a unique selling feature over their competitors. However, to reliably determine if a service is reusable, comprehensive service specifications are needed. Characteristic for comprehensive in contrast to syntactical specifications are the formalization of ontological and behavioral semantics, homogeneity according to a global ontology, and a service grounding that links the abstract service description and its technical realization. Homogeneous, semantical specifications enable to reliably identify reusable services, whereas the service grounding is needed for the technical service integration.   In general, comprehensive specifications are not available and have to be derived. Existing automatized approaches are restricted to certain characteristics of comprehensiveness. In my PhD, I consider an automatized approach to derive fully-fledged comprehensive specifications for black-box services. Ontological semantics are derived from syntactical interface specifications. Behavioral semantics are mined from call logs that cloud vendors create to monitor the hosted services. The specifications are harmonized over a global ontology. The service grounding is established using traceability information. The approach enables third party developers to compose services into complex systems and creates new sales channels for cloud and service providers.","published_for":"international conference on software engineering"},{"title":"Measuring the forensic-ability of audit logs for nonrepudiation","abstract":"Forensic analysis of software log files is used to extract user behavior profiles, detect fraud, and check compliance with policies and regulations. Software systems maintain several types of log files for different purposes. For example, a system may maintain logs for debugging, monitoring application performance, and/or tracking user access to system resources. The objective of my research is to develop and validate a minimum set of log file attributes and software security metrics for user nonrepudiation by measuring the degree to which a given audit log file captures the data necessary to allow for meaningful forensic analysis of user behavior within the software system. For a log to enable user nonrepudiation, the log file must record certain data fields, such as a unique user identifier. The log must also record relevant user activity, such as creating, viewing, updating, and deleting system resources, as well as software security events, such as the addition or revocation of user privileges. Using a grounded theory method, I propose a methodology for observing the current state of activity logging mechanisms in healthcare, education, and finance, then I quantify differences between activity logs and logs not specifically intended to capture user activity. I will then propose software security metrics for quantifying the forensic-ability of log files. I will evaluate my work with empirical analysis by comparing the performance of my metrics on several types of log files, including both activity logs and logs not directly intended to record user activity.

Cross-project defect prediction has been the main area of progress by reusing classifiers from other projects. However, existing approaches require some degree of homogeneity ( e.g. , a similar distribution of metric values) between the training projects and the target project. Satisfying the homogeneity requirement often requires significant effort (currently a very active area of research).   An unsupervised classifier does not require any training data, therefore the heterogeneity challenge is no longer an issue. In this paper, we examine two types of unsupervised classifiers: a) distance-based classifiers ( e.g. ,  k -means); and b) connectivity-based classifiers. While distance-based unsupervised classifiers have been previously used in the defect prediction literature with disappointing performance, connectivity-based classifiers have never been explored before in our community.   We compare the performance of unsupervised classifiers versus supervised classifiers using data from 26 projects from three publicly available datasets ( i.e. , AEEEM, NASA, and PROMISE). In the cross-project setting, our proposed connectivity-based classifier (via spectral clustering) ranks as one of the top classifiers among five widely-used supervised classifiers ( i.e. , random forest, naive Bayes, logistic regression, decision tree, and logistic model tree) and five unsupervised classifiers ( i.e. ,  k -means, partition around medoids, fuzzy C-means, neural-gas, and spectral clustering). In the within-project setting ( i.e. , models are built and applied on the same project), our spectral classifier ranks in the second tier, while only random forest ranks in the first tier. Hence, connectivity-based unsupervised classifiers offer a viable solution for cross and within project defect predictions.","published_for":"international conference on software engineering"},{"title":"Can Requirements Be Creative?

This paper introduces the concept of context-dependent coordination based on programmable interaction spaces. On the one hand, interaction spaces associated to different execution environments may be independently programmed so as to lead to differentiated, environment-dependent, behaviors. On the other hand, agents can program the interaction spaces of the visited execution environments to obtain an application-dependent behavior of the interaction spaces themselves. Several examples show how an infrastructure for context-dependent coordination can be exploited to simplify the design of Internet applications based on mobile agents. In addition, the MARS coordination infrastructure is presented as an example of a system in which the concept of context-dependent coordination has found a clean and efficient implementation.","published_for":"international conference on software engineering"},{"title":"CLIME: An environment for constrained evolution demonstration description","abstract":"We are building a software development environment that uses constraints to ensure the consistency of the different artifacts associated with software. This approach to software development makes the environment responsible for detecting most inconsistencies between software design, specifications, documentation, source code, and test cases. The environment provides facilities to ensure that these various dimensions remain consistent as the software is written and evolves. The environment works with the wide variety of artifacts typically associated with a large software system. It handles both the static and dynamic aspects of software. Moreover, it works incrementally so that consistency information is readily available to the developer as the system changes. The demonstration will show this environment and its capabilities.","published_for":"international conference on software engineering"},{"title":"Being jane malkovich: a look into the world of an XP customer","abstract":"One of the pivotal roles in XP is the customer, but little guidance is provided in the literature on the practicalities of succeeding in this role. We used an interpretative in-depth case study to explore a successful XP project. We obtained multiple perspectives on the implementation of the customer role, and this paper includes excerpts from interviews with the customer and other development team members. We found that the interviewees provided a consistent picture of the XP customer role and they agreed that the XP customer role, especially for larger organisations, is very demanding. It requires preparation, skills, attention to detail, and the ability to make critical decisions.","published_for":"international conference on software engineering"},{"title":"Using property rights theory to overcome success barriers to software development project: Protection of contractors' knowledge","abstract":"A fundamental tenet of the information systems discipline holds that: (a) changing requirements in software development projects (SDP) are the main reason for failure; (b) therefore, in case of such uncertainties, fixed-price contracts (FPC) are not suitable for success. Our research, informed by economic theories, compellingly illustrates that among other things changing requirements stems from missing protection on knowledge. In this paper, we present an analysis of knowledge difficult to protect. Both parties must share knowledge during the specification of requirements. However, this business knowledge is an essential intellectual property, and thus needs protection for misuse. We enact a strategy to achieve SDPs success despite these barriers. Our theoretical and empirical analysis also found that SDP success is largely an uncertainty problem between the contractors on the management level, and thus technical-organizational approaches alone are inadequate for achieving success. Based on property rights theory, we introduce two models for protecting knowledge depending on uncertainties. Our findings offer managers important insights into how they can design and enact FPC for effectively manage SDPs. Further, we show how the economic theories can enhance understanding of SDP dynamics and advance the development of a theory of effective control of SDP success.","published_for":"international conference on software engineering"},{"title":"SMACK software verification toolchain","abstract":"Tool prototyping is an essential step in developing novel software verification algorithms and techniques. However, implementing a verifier prototype that can handle real-world programs is a huge endeavor, which hinders researchers by forcing them to spend more time engineering tools, and less time innovating. In this paper, we present the SMACK software verification toolchain. The toolchain provides a modular and extensible software verification ecosystem that decouples the front-end source language details from back-end verification algorithms. It achieves that by translating from the LLVM compiler intermediate representation into the Boogie intermediate verification language. SMACK benefits the software verification community in several ways: (i) it can be used as an off-the-shelf software verifier in an applied software verification project, (ii) it enables researchers to rapidly develop and release new verification algorithms, (iii) it allows for adding support for new languages in its front-end. We have used SMACK to verify numerous C/C++ programs, including industry examples, showing it is mature and competitive. Likewise, SMACK is already being used in several existing verification research prototypes. Our demonstration of SMACK can be found on YouTube at the following address: https://youtu.be/SPPSC1KdRzs","published_for":"international conference on software engineering"},{"title":"Making a difference: an overview of humanitarian free open source systems","abstract":"Humanitarian Free Open Source Software (HFOSS) serves philanthropic goals that usually benefit non-profit organizations meant to improve the human condition. The altruistic goals these systems serve can offer developers additional motivation for contributing to OSS and have been seen as a way to attract more women to computing majors and to improve students' learning.   We present an exploratory study of the currently existing HFOSS projects, aimed at giving an overview of their properties, including the most common application domains and the most popular programming languages used in this kind of systems. We also investigated the assumption that HFOSS systems attract more women developers and found the assumption to be incorrect.","published_for":"international conference on software engineering"},{"title":"Code drones","abstract":"We propose and explore a new paradigm called Code Drones in which every software artifact such as a class is an intelligent and socially active entity. In this paradigm,  humanized  artifacts take the lead and choreograph (socially, in collaboration with other intelligent software artifacts and humans) automated software engineering solutions to a myriad of development and maintenance challenges, including API migration, reuse, documentation, testing, patching, and refactoring. We discuss the implications of having social and intelligent/cognitive software artifacts that guide their own self-improvement.","published_for":"international conference on software
